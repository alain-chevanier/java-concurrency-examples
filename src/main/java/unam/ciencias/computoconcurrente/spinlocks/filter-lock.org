* Filter Algorith Notes
Filter algorithm is an N-thread mutual exclusion protocol, the idea as follows, we have ~N~ levels if
if have ~N~ threads, for each level we store which thread arrived last, and for each thread we
store which level the thread is at; so we need a couple of arrays ~lastToArray~ and ~threadLevel~.
